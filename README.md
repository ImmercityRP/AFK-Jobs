# AFK-Jobs
A pre-configured ESX AFK Jobs script that is designed to allow players to go AFK for preset amounts of time, to earn a configurable payout - including a partial payment system! Keeps them alive and frozen in place, so nobody can mess with them. Allows you to add unlimited jobs, and change every detail - all from the Config!
